**Overview-**
The Password Strength Prediction Model leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to evaluate and predict the strength of passwords. This project analyzes password characteristics—such as length and character composition—to classify passwords into different strength categories: weak, medium, and strong.

**Features-**
1) Semantic Analysis: Identifies the type of characters in passwords, including numeric, uppercase, alphanumeric, title-case, and special characters.
2) Feature Engineering: Calculates various features like frequency of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.
3) Data Visualization: Uses boxplots and distribution plots to analyze and visualize feature distributions across different password strength categories.
4) Machine Learning: Applies a Multinomial Logistic Regression model using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to classify password strength.
