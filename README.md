**Overview-**
The Password Strength Prediction Model leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to evaluate and predict the strength of passwords. This project analyzes password characteristics—such as length and character composition—to classify passwords into different strength categories: weak, medium, and strong.

**Features-**

**1) Semantic Analysis:**
The first step involves analyzing the textual composition of passwords to identify their characteristics:
a) Numeric: Passwords composed entirely of numeric characters.
b) Uppercase: Passwords composed entirely of uppercase characters.
c) Alphanumeric: Passwords composed of both letters and numbers.
d) Title-case: Passwords where the first letter of each word is capitalized.
e) Special Characters: Passwords containing symbols from a set of special characters.

**2) Feature Engineering:** 
Several features are engineered to help in the prediction of password strength:
Frequency of Lowercase Characters: Proportion of lowercase letters in the password.
Frequency of Uppercase Characters: Proportion of uppercase letters in the password.
Frequency of Numeric Characters: Proportion of digits in the password.
Frequency of Special Characters: Proportion of special characters in the password.

**3) Data Visualization:**
Using boxplots and distribution plots to analyze and visualize feature distributions across different password strength categories.

**4) Machine Learning:**
TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts passwords into numerical data suitable for machine learning algorithms. The TF-IDF vectorizer transforms textual data into feature vectors that reflect the importance of words in the context of the entire dataset.

**Model Training:**
A Multinomial Logistic Regression model is used to classify passwords based on the engineered features and TF-IDF vectors.

**Model Evaluation:** 
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

**Results-**
The model achieves an accuracy of **80%**, indicating its effectiveness in predicting password strength based on the features and model used. The confusion matrix and classification report provide further insights into the model's performance across different categories of password strength.

**Feature Engineering:** Calculating the frequency of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters contributes valuable information for password classification.

**Visualization:** Data visualization techniques help in understanding the distribution of features and their relationship with password strength.

**Model Performance:** The Multinomial Logistic Regression model, trained with TF-IDF vectorization and engineered features, achieves an accuracy of 80%, demonstrating its capability to predict password strength effectively.

**Practical Implications:**
This model can be used to enhance security practices by providing a method for evaluating password strength, which is crucial for protecting sensitive information. It offers a scalable solution for applications that require password validation and can be integrated into security systems to assess and guide users in creating stronger passwords.

**Future Work:**
Future enhancements may include:
**Incorporating More Features:** Adding additional features such as password entropy or patterns could improve model accuracy.
